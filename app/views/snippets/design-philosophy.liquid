<p>As a designer and developer I am constantly weighing pros and cons. It's a common mistake to want to make things perfect, when good enough is what you actually need. That may sound like I approve of laziness or of not doing your best work, but it's far from it. In reality it's an admission that nothing will ever be perfect and there are always budgetary and time constraints that require us to make trade-offs. Being a good designer is being able to look at those constraints and make the best decisions within them. </p>

<p>Usability is the first and most important part of design and development. That means that sometimes function outweighs form. I always want to make something beautiful, but sometimes there just isn't enough time or money for it. There are ways to hide that one focused on function over form, and luckily those techniques are somewhat in fashion right now. Mainly - keep things simple. A focus on typography, spacing, whitespace, information hierarchy, and page speed can give you a great user experience without going deep into more advanced areas of design such as animation, transitions, asynchronous loading or other trending design techniques.</p>

<p>Another way to be a great designer -- while there are many who would never admit, and others who would not allow -- is to stand on the shoulders of the giants who have come before us. An incredible part of the design and development community of the web is that we love to share what we do and allow others to use what we've made in their own projects. Libraries, frameworks, tools, and utilities all exist to help us do the basics, and sometimes even the challenging stuff, without completely reinventing the wheel. As a designer we must use these tools to improve our capabilities. We often think to ourselves, 'I can do this better,' or, 'I'll just do this from scratch,' which completely dismisses why these tools exist to begin with. Others have worked hard on these so we don't have to -  and they often do it better then we could ever hope to.</p>

<p>Basically I advocate to keep design simple. Develop with your user in mind, and use the tools available to you instead of constantly reinventing the wheel. Work hard to create the best experience possible within the constraints you are given, and don't be afraid to learn something new.</p>
