<h3>St. Francis of Assisi Elementary School</h3>

<p>St. Francis Elementary school's redesign was long overdue, but when all was said and done I think they have a site that will stand strong for a long time.  They went from a 90s table-layout to a responsive full-banner homepage.  The difference was massive and can be seen immediately.</p>
<p>The redesign process was as much of a learning experience for me as any design I've taken part.  I like to get a site right when I design it, which often takes a few iterations.  This site went beyond 'a few' iterations and I quickly understood why some designers will put a cap on the number of changes allowed on any project.  I still stand by my no-cap design process though, as I believe it's more important to have happy client then a happy designer.  I also learned that as a designer, sometimes it's as important -- if not more -- to listen to clients initial design input than to try to come up with original solutions.  </p>
<p>Here is a video that rolls through many of the iterations of St. Francis' design.</p>
