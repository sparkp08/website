      much fun and giving myself far too little time to write.  I suppose it’s not
      so much a problem as a natural part of such an adventure.  For this reason I’m
      going to need to fast-forward through much of the boring stuff on which I’d
      love to elaborate and you’d doubtlessly love to read. I will however give a
      detail or two more starting where I last left you - the girl named Natalia.
       </p> <div style='text-align: center;'>-</div> <div style='text-align: center;'></div>
      <p>I’ll skip to the good part, she’s with me now - riding her bike alongside
      me northward through Chile and hopefully through many more countries to come.
       </p> <p style='text-align: center;'>-</p> <p>The night after we first meet
      she and her friend spend the day in Cochamo valley.  They leave their tent in
      the backyard where Willie and I are taking a rest day, and I assume they are
      going to be spending at least a day in the valley - considering the distance
      required to hike in and out.  I also know that we will be getting up early the
      next day and might not be abl e to reconnect with her before we set out.  I
      hadn’t gotten her phone number and had no way of contacting her.  With all that
      in mind I decide I will write a love letter of sorts, in spanish mind you, to
      leave in her tent with the hope that she was as interested in me as I was her.</p>
      <p>As I am putting the finishing touches on the letter complete with a hand-drawn
      map of our upcoming route, destinations, and the hope that she can meet me again
      somewhere close to her home in Osorno, she pops her head into the tent and says,
      ‘Hello!’  </p> <p>I think to myself, ‘Wait. What?! You just hiked 20km in and
      out of Cochamo in a day?’ But more thoughtfully smile, say, ‘Hi!’ and give her
      a big hug and kiss.  She tells me she and her friend are heading back to Osorno,
      and realizing I failed the first time I now take the opportunity to get her
      number. They had packed up the tent in absolute silence; seriously, I’m still
      not sure how I didn’t hear them.  So my plan is shot, and (let’s be real it’s
      the twenty-first century) I’m not about to just hand her this letter and wait
      for rejection in person.  Machismo, I know. In all the excitement I was too
      nervous and unprepared to give her the letter.  Fail. Again. It’s ok though.
      After a quick proofread I send a photo of the letter to her phone with a short
      explanation of my plan to sweep her off her feet with the letter in the tent.
       </p> <p>Though, it does seem the modern way carried enough persuasion.  She
      agrees to meet us in a week’s time in Entre Lagos which is north of Puerto Varas
      and the closest point to Osorno that we’ll be passing before heading east into
      Argentina.  Apparently my interest in her was not one sided.  Ok, enough of
      this silly love stuff, back to the riding.</p> <p style='text-align: center;'><a

      alt='' /></a></p> <p>The next two days we head west on dirt roads that the Chileans
      call ripio.  It’s more gravel, rocks, and rollers than dirt and is my first
      experience of non-asphalt cycling in years.  It takes me a long while to get
      used to this stuff and I won’t be truly comfortable on it until our next batch
      of off-roading which is on the other side of the Andes in two week’s time.  I
      take at least three small crashes (tip: if you find yourself heading off road
      or in the wrong direction on gravel, don’t try to correct it quickly or even
      at all.  Just hit your brakes and crash slowly into whatever you are heading
      towards.  A quick correction is going to put your front wheel into a skid and
      you are going to crash. Crashing is not considered good.) and thank myself for
      wearing gloves while riding.  </p> <p><a href='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_wQqxjKz_-f7PlCFELYh4lYgQTwdwcfV4Xk3xOtqYuyv5TMsDYt6UGSbJvG2SFRDN-1lzLHXjOiaD6IO0ZOe7x_yHR1jGBlkgU7kduKPusBibBwBdJkQrneoDMwanBYnkERnNYtik4NzdKu3_N5cBHjBfxQHpCaTTMzcAF1GCaREH7pZwmC-csELK9oFdrNhPdooiCgjwF5D2kIx_RC_z2wLwweb51hO9Eop3AJrd2wGEyLtwjZXOxt6zNq8iAISmOr_2FPWXG45kMdaX069AwFwKO1lVISpuxQGZyRuj3dsxXHCtAxwmd3t0mrr1z6ELX8a70r5kolHoyAn5DnXxsYluykNXS9fW70MAxek6Om3eAzgZ4jt34L7_Ohka7JZV1BCmlXY2IX5VD9uIf8_V7PNRa9GiVQr-8vwmJ_ugee9LqlIOA27ijvSNwuE88y_9FVX2kzINNqrJCyE7MyAmyiK-mnG9lkRDZlb06DxYWxxbN8hoE57n78rXdOI13k9MlyeF4EPWJxRvwHVml5X-w7HL-xb_HSioah-sfDO7radZRbtMqwT6BJT9qQlCEYVcy1A=w1248-h627-no'

      at least thirty other campers and enjoy the blaring music of one group until
      well past midnight.  It stuns me not only that someone is insensitive enough
      to blast music from their car until that hour at a camp with as many other people
      but also that no one else goes over to tell them to shut the hell up.  As it
      turns out this isn’t all that abnormal in Chile and we will be running into
      a few of this type of person in the coming weeks and months.  </p> <div style='text-align:

      <p>The next day is the most difficult day of riding we have had.  Massive climbing
      on dirt roads requires me to get off and push more than once.  When we finally
      make it back to asphalt it feels like a miracle.  We hop on a ferry to cross
      from the small town, Puelche, to another small town, La Arena.  There are some
      incredible empanadas waiting for us in La Arena as well as a super friendly
      empanada shack owner who allows us to camp on his property.  </p> <p style='text-align:

      feels like a breeze. It was a 60+Km day, but given the last two days on ripio,
      the asphalt and rollers are no problem at all. With the test loop under our
      belts, we rest for another day at Willie’s adopted parents and then head out
      for the beginning of the actual journey.  Our first leg is north to Espantapajaro’s
      - Willie’s favorite restaurant in the world.  It’s a buffet with as much food
      and drink (wine, beer, and spirits) as you could ever want.  We gorge and set
      up camp again on another friendly owner’s property.  </p> <p style='text-align:

      a 75+Km day by missing a turnoff.  Upon turning around I’m heading straight
      into the wind and it sucks. It puts us late getting into Entre Lagos where I’m
      to be meeting Natalia.  We don’t arrive into town until after 7pm and even though

      a little bit better and explore the quaint little town of Entre Lagos together.
      I learn she is finishing her thesis in philosophy at the Catholic University
      in Santiago, but had taken some time off a bit ago to do some acting in Valparaiso.
       She also sells cheese. So, she studies philosophy, is an actress, sells cheese
      and lives in southern Chile.  I learned much more about her that day, but really
      what more could you ask for than that?</p> <p>The next day we decide she can’t
      go home yet so she grabs a bus to our next stop - Aguas Calientes hot springs
      in Puyehue national park - and meets us there a few hours after we set off on
      our bikes.  We spend two days in Aguas Calientes relaxing our muscles in the
      natural  hot water.  Willie and I have our first pass of the Andes ahead, so
      we use this time to plan and get mentally prepared.  As part of our mental preparations
      we work on convincing Natalia that she needs to join us on our bicycle adventure,
      of which she seems surprisingly interested.  </p> <p style='text-align: center;'><a

      I stay in touch by phone, and she tells me that she has decided to join the
      adventure.  She’s got a bike, her mother made a set of panniers, and since she’s
      been training for a half marathon in Santiago that has put her in great shape
      to start riding her bike every day.  Her plan, somewhat like mine, is unknown.
       She wants to explore the world and learn as much as she can along the way,
      and she happens to want to do it with me.  So I’ve got that goin for me, which
      is nice.  </p> <h3><a href='https://goo.gl/photos/jp8uyRYeJf8bwiTa8' target='_blank'

    content: "<p>From Puerto Varas we head northwest along the coast of Lake Puyehue
      to the small lake town of Ensenada.  Our first night camping is on the shores
      of the lake and we are welcomed with a stunning sunset and the grand arm of
      the Milky Way shining above our heads.  Volcan Osorno towers above our stay
      and reminds me of Mt. Fuji with its long easing slopes and snow capped peak.
       I think it is special, but as we continue our ride the volcanoes spot the landscape
      endlessly. This is a foreign place in every manner of the word. <p> </p> <p

      sore legs and a restful night of sleep.  The ride begins with much more difficulty
      than the last.  Even the small hills are painful and my rhythm is not coming
      easily.  What have I got myself into? This is only day two and I’m hurting.
       It’s ok, I tell myself.  If I expected one thing, it was pain or as they say
      on the Tour, ‘suffering.’ We stop and buy some honey cookies from a house on
      the side of the road and Willie points out me a friendly little tarantula on
      the side of the road.  </p> <p> </p> <p style='text-align: center;'><img alt=''

      and long downhills a supremely generous man stops Willie and offers a ride in
      the back of his truck all the way to Cochamo.  We are about 20km into what would
      have been a 50km day and happily accept the help.  We lift our bikes and bags
      into the back of his truck and tuck ourselves in for a bumpy and hilly ride
      with stupendous views of lakes and mountains passing by.  The trucker picks
      up two more thankful souls, one of whom is a stunningly beautiful - though hairy
      armpitted - girl who spent most of the ride with an eyes-closed smile and the
      wind blowing in her face as if she were part of a movie scene.  </p> <p> </p>

      like stepping into a tale from Tolkien.  Seems too perfect to be true.  A massive

      style='float: none;' /></p> <p>We find the place that Willie had stayed a week
      prior and set up camp in the backyard of this family eatery for 500 pesos a
      night; eighty-two cents by Willie’s quick calculations. We buy a couple of smoked
      salmon steaks, with melted Gouda, a spicy avocado sauce and bottled cokes all
      for less than ten dollars US. Eating this, overlooking the fjord with a volcano
      centered in the background (yes a different one), is a moment I’ll remember
      for long to come.  </p> <p><br />Camp is set up and and we crash soon after
      dark to prepare for the early morning ahead. We wake to soaked tents and sleeping
      bags. Southern Chile is humid and all the water in the air condenses at night
      on any surface it can find.  All our stuff is going to be getting wet while
      we are here - noted.  There isn’t much we can actually do about that, but at
      least we know and can prepare to to dry things out regularly.  This morning
      that’s not an option unfortunately.  We pack our tents, sleeping bags, and necessary
      camp supplies in a hurry.  A local caravan takes the campers from this lakeside
      backyard to the trail-head of Cochamo valley each morning and right now they're waiting
      on us.  Somehow I fit everything including my camera and lenses either into,
      or strapped on top of my small 30L backpack for the three day excursion upon
      which we are about to embark.  </p> <p><br />The hike to La Junta - the campground
      and joining of rivers in this yosemite-esque valley -  is about 20km and is
      slightly uphill the whole way.  I huff and puff most of the way and have to
      ask for a few breaks for food and breath.  Even though I am abhorrently out
      of shape, I enjoy the beauty of the diverse and new plant life that the valley
      forest has to offer.  I take in new trees with massive winding roots, ferns
      larger than Jack and David’s ‘house,’ and streams rushing over moss covered
      rocks that we often have to traverse.  Jurassic Park, Middle Earth, Fern Gully;
      whichever you picked the scenery wouldn’t be far off at some point or another.
       A few times along the hike the scenery opened up and gave us hits of the valley
      ahead.  At one point on a lunch break I sarcastically suggest we just stay put
      since the view was beautiful, but two passing hikers tell us, ‘You must trek
      on, La Junta is totally worth it.’  </p> <p style='text-align: center;'><a href='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZuiYJXA-9SieJHUA8DScEsXU9gcmt2oq4sEICOlNOvNQNKTzumPk-tA0HU4txyBVxOn2DZkC4sllMStSmnrd0gS04gkajsAzvuyz-zeivV9byZiXYuuAWbb8IZoKzeZimXqiyoHVHysHmrzYD258R_50Z8NJTfCWOYJ6hYLLTkDLuQhM5TFGdBLpFaOOlNIeWJhOMaYn04A_YsYGEHzqAeRHpY5fW7EptyIf2qqGfa8yqD5Y29zTIFt3x-93vD_t1B--TwCytNzgG-WgpaDQ6n3LVYVgRpJ7Ixon6uEquBrZfJfE8hayDRB8tKmTQg5tS_uqxAtSfcc2_FBJoW4GxpVyoJRb1Ku5ckoSdxtd8wQADj8FXBOr4NxbC8KnD13-uggL5m847_VvksQRSWIGMcbsahLgoesk3CB3pUhkTvB7oOJ_NMBSd3Afn2pJCNrjHLHScQiZIXIQTvcaL4Vob7XPmUzS7fWtTUjmLiEKXQfNePE1AxQ4OjJPa5Ihzx-9-1tD_SeF1zW65pl3PimBiMDZrMtr9N17LcNoCxVY_Zek41ReAGiHm5RZQVB3Qu7Y7x1P=w491-h654-no'

      is totally worth it. As I pass into the opening of the valley-meadow my jaw
      drops. I stop dead and spin round and round as the granite walls stretch endlessly
      in every direction. The meadow is covered in thin perfectly green grass, rolling
      hills and trees scattered here and there. It reminds me of hobbiton. I wouldn’t
      be surprised to find a round door in the side of a hill somewhere with a little
      fellow named Bilbo gardening outside.</p> <p> </p> <div style='text-align: center;'><iframe

      afternoon we set up camp, make food, and ready ourselves mentally for another
      long day tomorrow. We enjoy freshly baked bread from a wonderful lady who has
      set up permanent residence in the valley with a wood-fire stove. She has supplies
      brought in; fresh produce and flour so she can sell goodies to the campers and
      climbers who make there way to the valley and want to stay for longer than their
      supplies allow. The bread is some of the densest, most delicious I’ve ever had,
      and is almost always warm when you get it.</p> <p style='text-align: center;'><a

      me not as easily or willingly as the day prior. Willie wants desperately to
      climb into the Amfitheatro. From the valley floor it’s easily seen as a massive
      bowl of granite from which Half Dome could have easily been pulled - if Half
      Dome weren’t half-way around the world. Willie tells me it will be another three
      to four hour hike and it will be more difficult than the hike into the valley.
      Great, as if I’m not already completely beat and my legs aren’t screaming at
      me. I’m here though, and I’m sure as hell not just going to sit in the valley
      all day.</p> <p style='text-align: center;'> <iframe src='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHwdB4PRVvHGSTR_S-aJsyWuEvNEjvV4HA/preview'
      width='640' height='480'></iframe></p> <p><br /> We get hiking and I quickly
      discover this isn’t anything like the hike the day before. The trail is clearly
      new, traveled lightly and often lost. At times it feels like we’re climbing
      straight up the side of the cliff it’s so steep. The roots and vegetation are
      ominously devious and regularly call for both hands and feet in order to traverse
      and overcome their gnarled ways. Although arduous, this trek is once again well
      worth it. Along the way we cross waterfalls and streams a plenty.</p> <p style='text-align:

      alt='' /></a></p> <p>Nearing the top of the hike we begin to hear voices and
      find a climber family posted at the base of the amfitheatro enjoying some rest
      day yoga. We cruise by their camp and come out from under the canopy for the
      first time in hours. The sun shines brightly as we are welcomed with open arms
      by the amfitheatro. It’s time for another jaw-dropped 360 and to look back down
      from where we came. We hike up farther into the amfitheatro and gaze down on
      the cascading forest that drop off like a waterfall into the valley below. The
      walls that make up the great are even larger than I imagined. It must be another
      1,500 feet of pure cliff face to actually get out of this place, and would take
      another hour just to get to the back wall of the theater itself.</p> <p style='text-align:

      alt='' /></a></p> <p><br /> We find a boulder with a flat top, drop our things
      and relax for a bit. Willie scrambles off shortly to explore more of the area
      that surrounds and I sit contentedly taking things in from my perch. Quickly
      I discover, not by sight but instead sound, that there are climbers on the walls
      that surround me. The yells that are regular conversation among climbers a pitch
      apart from one another echoe loudly in nature’s theater.</p> <p><br /> After
      an hour or so of perfect relaxation I start to make my way up the direction
      that Willie headed. Where did he end up? I couldn’t find him amongst the boulders
      above since he went leaping over the nearest ones. I scramble and at times climb
      up and over a stream of rocks and boulders that so clearly crashed down from
      the walls above. I hike and trudge for nearly an hour with many a rocks and
      small boulders giving way under my feet as I climb. This is a place less travelled.
      I’m used to scrambling in areas that have been jumped on made sturdy by the
      test of many others before me, but now I’m put to the test. More than once I
      have to backtrack as the ground is simply falling beneath my feet to quickly.
      With every step another rock goes tumbling down beneath me with an echoing crash
      and tumble. Reminding myself that if not careful I will be the one tumbling,
      I lumber on until I hear a whistle from below. On the now small boulder upon
      which I had sat not long ago is Willie who is now the nearly the size of an
      ant and waving is shirt on a stick so I can spot him.</p> <p style='text-align:

      alt='' /></p> <p><br />How did we pass without seeing each other?</p> <p><br
      />This place is huge, that’s how. I continue farther than I can safely go, and
      then further still. Upon realizing that I chose the wrong way to get to the
      back of the theater I turn around and slide my way down what seems like a forty-five
      degree slope of gravel and rocks making enough noise to surely be heard on the
      valley floor. After some fun downhill scrambling over boulder and boulder I
      arrive at our trusty outlook, snack on some bread and honey, and read a few
      chapters of The Hobbit.</p> <p><br />We make our way back down to the valley
      floor in much less time than it took to get up and stock up on fresh bread from
      our favorite bakery. That night I take my first go at Chilean star photos and
      fail miserably. The humid weather fogs my lens a couple hundred shots into my
      timelapse and pretty much ruins the shoot. Welp, at least that’s not something
      I need to worry about once we’re farther north into the desert. I guess I don’t
      get to shoot timelapses in southern Chile, considering I have no idea how I
      would avoid that problem.</p> <p><br />With a long day and late night behind
      us we sleep like rocks and don’t bother with getting up early. By some time
      in the early afternoon we have all our things packed up and are finally ready
      to make the long hike back into the town of Cochamo. Luckily this will be the
      easiest hike of the last few days and with that in mind I pop my headphones
      in and blast off. I’m thinking about papas fritas and smoked salmon back at
      camp, along with the rest day that we decided on for tomorrow.</p> <p><br />Arriving
      back in town we find our little backyard campsite and I see a beautiful girl
      setting up her tent in our spot (as if there are any reservations at this place).
      Willie says something to her jokingly in Spanish that I don’t understand, and
      I quickly say ‘Hola’ and slink quietly away, thinking only of how I must stink
      to high-heaven after the last three days of arduous activity.</p> <p><br />Later
      that night after setting up camp, brushing my teeth, and getting ready for bed
      this beautiful girl comes up to me and asks what my name is. I ask for hers,
      and after few minutes of small-talk and sharing my not-so-perfect star photos I
      forget it and ask for it again. She calls me out for having a terrible memory
      and we laugh. I sure as hell don’t forget it a second time. Natalia is her name
      and it seems she is going to become a larger part of this story than I would
      have ever imagined.</p>"

      <p>The Short of it:</p>
      <p>Bike, Willy, and I are in good shape and great spirits.  I’m writing from a hostel in San Martin de Los Andes.  </p> <p><strong></strong>So it seems embedding a table into the layout and having it appear in the preview for the blog post causes a few pages on my site to break.  The fastest and simplest way for me to fix that is to write more words before the table so that it doesn't appear in preview.  What I'm saying is that this whole paragraph is meaningless other than as a buffer to hide the table from the blog preview.  If you want to get info on the rides we've done so far I'd recommend clicking on this post and you'll get all the info you could hope for.  Anyhow I think this is probably enough words and I'm going to call it good.</p> <p> </p> <p>Rides (starting from Puerto Varas):</p>

    title: Valdivia
    posted_at: '2016-03-18'
    content: "<p>It’s stunning that it’s been three weeks since I wrote about those
      first three days in Santiago.  If that was a whirlwind this has been a hurricane
      - in the best way possible.  </p> <p>Arriving in Valdivia my couchsurfing host,
      Jack, offers to meet me at the bus station to help get my things back to his
      house. I accept kindly as I'm carrying more than I can comfortably handle and
      have no idea where anything is in this town nor can I communicate with anyone.
       Jack is an interesting fellow to say the least.  When he greets me I don’t
      expect him to be British, or have one of the thickest accent I’ve ever heard.
      His rosy-pale complexion and lanky frail composure combine to a near comical
      presence. I learn he is in Valdivia by complete chance, having been placed there
      to teach english at the local university.  His confidence and mature ease makes
      him seem older than he is, but at the same time when he tells me he is only
      twenty-two it's really no surprise.  He’s a complex guy with surely more to
      tell than I got the chance to hear, but couldn’t possibly be a more hospitable
      and welcoming host to this new and beautiful town of Valdivia.</p> <p>After
      walking around the block with my heavy bags to find a cab, which would have
      been much easier to just grab one from the bus station, we shove my things into
      the small car and make off to his abode.  With some hesitation he gives directions
      to the cabby, and when we arrive at the street he says, ‘Yes. I think this is
      it...’ </p> <p>Great that's the kind of thing I'm getting into.  Not even sure
      where his house is. I learn later that this is a new house and they only moved-in
      less than a week ago.</p> <p>At first the key doesn’t work to the front gate,
      but with some finagling he jiggles it open. Ok this <em>is</em> the place, phew.
      We find a place for my bike box and he opens the front door to what must surely
      be the smallest home in which I’ve ever stayed.  Definitely challenges the square
      foot to person ratio record for the time in which I stayed there.</p> <p>The
      bottom floor is about twelve feet by ten feet.  There is a kitchen table, couch,
      small fridge, oven, sink, and shelves above with barely enough room to negotiate
      my bags and myself.  The stairs would more comfortably be called a ladder, and
      it’d be untruthful to say I didn’t fall down them more than once during my short
      stay. The top floor is the same size as the bottom with the addition of a bathroom
      that I can’t get into without turning sideways.  That’s no exaggeration.  Walking
      straight into the bathroom would cause my shoulders to hit both sides of the
      door frame.  Feels almost surreal.  First this place exists, and then those
      who live here welcome outsiders with open arms to share in the little extra
      space they have.  I love it.</p> <p>After a cup of instant coffee and learning
      of Jack’s origins (Nottingham forest where Robinhood is from) the second comical
      resident comes home from work to make us lunch.  David (Daveed) couldn’t be
      more different than Jack if he tried. How to describe this incredible man? He’s
      the Chilean edition of the kid from Up aged twenty years. He provides the warmest
      and most welcoming hugs one could imagine and cooks like a champ.  He works
      at a natural food store and has lived in Valdivia his whole life.  Although
      his bones are big, he hasn’t an urgent or sullen one in his body.  He takes
      his time making us lunch; salad, main course of rice, beans and tomatoes with
      spices, and of course plenty of Chilean wine.  He ensures everything is just
      right before we begin this important meal.  Apparently I'm their first couchsurfer
      in the new house, so this is a kind of house warming lunch.  The table is set,
      the wine is opened, and the food is on the table. Let’s eat.  Rice and beans is
      great, wine is amazing, and salad is, well, salad. </p> <p>Willie and I later
      concluded that they are a super-hero duo in disguise.  Anyone want to take a
      gander at what their powers would be?</p> <p><a href='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4TGwbnD36zIZL2W0ldT7_tDoeZMXgVbzNy_1-TD8rlxarmGf3S7fptSH6rZg-pZ-77hDyw6SSH30iqFMqbJUFAowR01RvA5uaBRF_rx2LCP8NXktimr54UFD-7KrbUHAx00pn0Q-3CB1oq6uKdxl4-_mmGcC_9CimE8SGlcCKfK-Ipk-GYXXlh3bQqyhGKynNB9WAW-U4F6KqW7VCdahViPMOOEfLG-xw9m5g_VPBQ1wQRb7YcadxqMJsIaYBoCd_VkPvTYx_SnRbP2dGyRORnvggGZYUitA8ZN1FwPjbqr7y5HJxlswBrlXl9N0UWROMsVEovhHKWFHTnjQSyccCq7bv65hKqwILcFq3mNd1U1PiNGE46FgdQUIrJcuS6doShvlJX_T6Oauz6v00CTVd5G1a9VvMHn-Rh3mJgtRzAlgO4HoDOlUMvPZbH7uOGbX00e2J_kT8OWmQAR_vqMtxiTa07OFxYVBGCoh5tBfwU3rKg8b-ibG3l8GePeKnG59j2IcoPqdnOGn4elPiB0bowfFniK846FPnDDfRm6mkHV7Po3zxPK-F31X7Hl3nyCnXnio=w1216-h670-no%20'

      to work, Jack and I clean up lunch, and head out for a tour of the city.  For
      a relatively small city Valdivia is happening.  It reminds me a lot of San Luis
      Obispo.  The city has a university, is roughly fifteen minutes from the beach
      and the downtown has much to offer including a mall and a street of bars for
      the students.  There is a daily market that sells every type of seafood I know
      along with some I don’t.  Salmon for a dollar a pound that was caught that day.
       Fresh produce and flowers again with more variety than I’ve ever seen.  This
      place is a trip.  </p> <p><a href='https://photos.google.com/search/_p35c9b4ab79b2d79b_Valdivia/photo/AF1QipPOYXncrZEOMCt3IfdYESeolAm1rsNVeafvSLAS'

      alt='' /></a></p> <p>I learn that this weekend is the last of the summer holiday,
      and Valdivia has a customary festival to celebrate - it should be the busiest
      and most exciting weekend of the year.  Live music, foam spray and confetti,
      actual decorated floats (not the ones on streets. They decorate boats and I
      learn where the term ‘float’ comes from - at least a figure that’s where it
      comes from), and fireworks to cap it all off.  It seems this trip will be filled
      with unexpected happenings of an incredible sort. Is it a result of my complete
      lack of research and expectations,  or have I just stumbled into a dream that
      won’t end?  Whatever it might be I’m experiencing things as they come and so
      far they are fantastic.  </p> <p><a href='https://photos.google.com/search/_p35c9b4ab79b2d79b_Valdivia/photo/AF1QipPjbCCehcrIhPbLF0RySbUoofWT1ikRkyf9soeB'

      we greet each other with a big hug and catch up quickly.  He’s with a girl who

      kicked it off.  She’s from Quebec, is absolutely lovely, and has been travelling

      well, so I get a chance to meet them before we crashed at their house for a
      night.  Willie had met them a few weeks ago through Warm Showers and has become
      their de facto adopted son - staying at their home intermittently between his
      tour and travels earlier that month.  They are only a few years older than us,
      but have warm souls and feel like an old happy couple that are exactly where
      they are supposed to be in every moment.  Lucas fixes and rides bikes as much
      as he can in his free time, so he’s exceptionally excited for our trip. Paloma
      is getting ready to go back to school teaching, and although isn’t quite as
      excited for that, is still happy for us and welcomes us into her home.  </p>

    title: Starting off with Santiago
    posted_at: '2016-02-25'
    content: |-
      <p>Thursday evening is rushing in and I’ve got a bus to catch.  I’ll be travelling all night to Valdivia where I’ll stay with a friendly couch-surfing host for a couple days then head to Puerto Varas to meet Willie.</p>
      <p>The last few days have been a whirlwind.  I arrived in Santiago around 4am on Tuesday morning after almost 18 hours of travel.  Surprisingly (or perhaps I just have low expectations) after two layovers my massive bike box and bags arrived in what seemed to be good shape.  I grabbed a coffee at the airport and read some articles on my phone, hoping to give my host, Sandra, a little bit of time so I wouldn’t wake her up too long before her regular hours.  Nonetheless I still arrive to Sandra’s apartment around 5:30am and after a quick orientation and finagling my massive cargo into the cozy apartment I crashed on the futon for some much needed rest.</p>
      <p>Day 1</p>
      <p>I wake with a start around 10:30am. Where am I? Oh, right. <i>This</i> is Santiago.  TIme to go explore! The city is absolutely bustling. People, cars, construction, shops, greenery - everywhere you look is something new to see.  Dogs, lots of wild dogs.  Though they all look pretty happy and healthy if I’m honest. I think Santiago would be my city of choice if I were a wild pup.</p>
      <p>I make my way a few blocks up the road and find myself at the base of a hilly green park, flush with grass and trees.  I start walking upward along a path and make my way to what I thought was the top of the hill only the find there is a castle of sorts sitting on top of the park.  It seems to be open to the public - the inside is some kind of museum that I chose not to explore.  There is a path that circles around the castle, up dangerously smooth and surprisingly steep steps to a lookout that gives a great overview of Santiago.  A young man is playing his guitar at the lookout and damn is he good. He plays some beautiful spanish songs and sets the mood perfectly for this serendipitous occurrence.  Then he plays something I recognize, but still haven’t put my finger on it. I spend my time watching the city as others come and go - it’s truly a perfect place to be - why leave in a hurry?  The guitarist packs his things up and I hand him a few dollars as he goes.  I think to myself, I should get some pesos from the next ATM, though he does seem genuinely pleased with the foreign money.</p>
      <p>Next mission - find some lunch.  I make my way down from the lookout only slipping on five or ten steps, and start wandering the streets.  It’s 12:30 or so but all the restaurants seem nearly empty.  I’m hoping to judge the good ones by their traffic, but it doesn’t seem like anything is busy.  Weird.  I find a little restaurant that has wifi and sit down for a shrimp-pesto pizza and a coke.  Just what I needed and I’m a happy camper.  I update the family that I’m safe and sound, check the social media and head back to the apartment.  Now it makes sense as to why everything was empty earlier - people around here live on a different schedule.  Lunch at noon is early.  It’s around 1:30pm and all the restaurants are getting busy.  I walk past one called Buffalo Waffles and it’s got a line out the door.  Welp gotta hit that up tomorrow.</p>
      <p>I meet Sandra and she kindly agrees to show me around the city a little bit.  We walk to the Plaza de Armas and I get to see some beautiful architecture and enjoy a bit of the city life. After a tour of the main attractions in the city center we head back in the direction of the apartment.  Sandra asks if I’ve tried something called terremoto.  I admit that I haven’t and that I also have no idea what it is.  She takes me to a little restaurant near her apartment and we order two terramotos and some papas fritas (french fries - I’m learning spanish!).  I find out shortly after we order, that terremoto not only means eathquake but is a Chilean drink with the best things.  Start things off with white wine (the cheapest you can get), plop a scoop of pineapple ice cream on top, and pour some flavored syrup on top of that (still not sure about the syrup’s flavor) - my god could you get in trouble with this stuff.  America step your glutton game up.  This is off the charts delicious.    </p>
      <p>Day 2</p>
      <p>Cerro san Cristobal is an even larger hill that has magnificent views of the city and the Andes that surround.  I set out to hike up it, and although I definitely ended up on the path less traveled I made it to the top in about an hour.  At the top is a massive statue of Mary and an outdoor altar where you can go to mass if you time things right.  The only disappointment of Cerro san Cristobal was that the trees were everywhere which made a clear 180 degree view of the city impossible.  Not that I can really complain about anything, but I was hoping for a more sprawling view of the city.  The view of the Andes and thunder-clouds hovering ominously over them was something to marvel at though.  They are without a doubt the most massive mountains I’ve ever seen.  Even though it’s summer there’s still snow topping them off and by looks of it, potentially some new powder falling. </p>
      <p>I meander down much faster than it took me to get up, and even though I snacked on some pastries at the top of the hill that I’d bought earlier in the morning, I was ready for some real lunch.  I make my way to Buffalo Waffles and order a double ham and cheese burrito of sorts.  Only instead of a tortilla this burrito is wrapped in a freshly baked waffle.  Ham, cheese, arugula, tomato, onion strings, bbq sauce and honey mustard.  I’m in heaven and wolff this monstrosity down.  </p>
      <p>With fuel in the tank I head back to the apartment to enjoy some time at the rooftop pool.  I find the pool, get a quick burn, go for a short swim and head downstairs to get cleaned up for the night. </p>
      <p>Completely coincidentally a college friend, Paul, is working in Santiago and saw a post of mine on facebook.  We’re able to get in touch and decide to meet up for dinner.  One of his co-workers is having a get-together and welcomes me into his apartment.  He meets me at my place and we Uber across town to his co-worker’s abode.  While on the way Paul chats in Spanish with the Uber driver and I realize I am somewhat following the conversation.  It’s a nice feeling to know that I can jump back on the proverbial bicycle and possibly pick up this language even faster than I was expecting.  I’m giving myself two months to be conversational.  I think it’s possible.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to show up empty handed we search madly for a shop to buy wine and forks(a request of the host).  We get a couple bottles of Chilean wine and have our second wild-goose chase of the night for the apartment building of the party.  The GPS marker that we are getting was about a block off from where they actually are.  With quite a bit of struggle and after asking several strangers where the address is, we finally happen upon the entrance and meet our new friends at the pool.  </p>
      <p>The night is exceptionally fun.  It was the most diverse group of party guests I’ve been a part of in my life.  There are three lovely young women; one from Spain, the second from the US (Kentucky if I recall correctly), and the third from Switzerland.  The guys were similarly far spread in terms of origin; one from Ireland, a second from Spain, one from Argentina and Paul and I from the US.  </p>
      <p>It’s a delight to chat with people, who are all my age, about our similarities and common interests.  They are excited to hear about the trip on which I”m embarking and have lots of questions.  I oblige with the most common answer being, ‘I haven’t figured that out yet.’  Unlike many of the responses I’ve gotten to telling people I don’t have strict plans or really anything figured out for this trip, they are pleasantly supportive and understanding in the idea that you just can’t map out an eight month trip and expect things to go to plan.  We all agree to some extent that playing it by ear and taking it one, or maybe, a few days at a time is best.  </p>
      <p>We also talked some politics (I know! big party foul, but it remained civilized).  FYI, these foreigners know as much if not more about the current election and American politics than most Americans my age do.  Perhaps that’s telling of the current situation. They are just as worried about the election as I am, and similarly are confused as to why Trump has as much of a following as he does.  Which, just to note, I’ve still yet to meet anyone who admits to actually supporting or who knows anyone who supports the guy.  </p>
      <p>For dinner I eat Octopus for the first time in my life.  It has a similar texture to squid/calamari and a relatively mild flavor.  I actually really like it.  Our host also serves us a ‘tortilla’ which is unlike any tortilla I’ve ever eaten.  It is layered scalloped potatoes and scrambled egg cooked in a skillet until it becomes a solid hunk of deliciousness.  Closer to a quice than a tortilla, but awesome either way. I also gulped down the Chilean wine which absolutely hit the spot.  Life is good in Chile. </p>
      <p>Day 3</p>
      <p>I wake slowly.  And I mean slowwly.  I guess I drank a little bit more of that Chilean wine than I thought.  Oh well.  This will be my last day in Santiago, so I need to figure out my bus down to Valdivia.  I catch a cab outside of the apartment and say, ‘A la terminal Santiago para la autobus.’ </p>
      <p>‘Oke.’  </p> <p>Woohoo! Figuring this out. And off we go. Fifteen minutes later I’m waiting in line for a TurBus and once again have to navigate buying tickets with a non-english speaking lady who is very kind and patient with me.  </p>
      <p>Yo nececisito una tiqueta(?) para Valdivia a noche por favor.  </p>
      <p>Once again I’m amazing and somehow she understands what I need.  I buy the ticket and catch another cab back to la Plaza de Armas.  When we visited two days prior the cathedral was closed and I wanted to walk through it and get a look.  I had also seen lots of food that was calling my name.  </p>
      <p>The cathedral is beautiful.  People are sitting quietly praying.  Some are taking pictures, others walking around taking in everything.  There are several side chapels, paintings and statues that are incredible.  I don’t spend a ton of time here, but the time I had was well worth the stop.  I head out to the Plaza and walk around looking to stay in the shade as much as possible. It’s hot and I did a good job of taking in the sun yesterday. Or should I say bad job? I took in the sun, put your own spin on it.</p>
      <p>I want one of those hotdogs piled high with stuff generally reserved for tacos.  I find a shop called Domino’s - no it’s not the pizza place - and order a hotdog with chilis, tomatoes and cheese. A coke and water to wash it all down makes me a happy man.  I’m starting to wake up now. WIth food in my belly and a little kick from my soda pop I walk back to the apartment to make sure all my belongings are ready for the trip tonight.  </p>
      <p>Damnit. For the first time this trip I’m lost.  I swear I was supposed to go up two blocks and take a left then a few more blocks and the apartment building should be right there.  I don’t have service on my phone, but I do have a GPS app that has downloaded maps.  I’m way off.  I think I was supposed to take a right instead of a left.  Whatever caused the confusion (probably that little alley I walked through - it looked so cool!), I backtrack and find the apartment with one stop for a popsicle.  Orange creamsicle. Who can be frustrated with an orange creamsicle? </p>
      <p>Back at the apartment Sandra is home early from work.  She graciously helps me find a taxi that’s big enough to fit my massive bike box.  She calls business after business and finally finds one that says they can help.  This is one hurdle I’m not sure I wouldn’t have gotten over without her.  If you are reading this, thanks Sandra!  I get all my bags packed up, and we head out for a last meal of Bife con Pobre (fried egg on top of beef on top of fries - yes this is a health food trip. not) before I have to leave.  I also have a Kuntsman beer from southern Chile and it’s absolutely fantastic.  Caramelly and smooth.  Definitely going to get some more of those along the way.</p>
      <p>We head back to the apartment, grab my bags, shove them in taxi and say our goodbyes.  Although there is mad traffic in the city I make the bus on time and even have a sandwich that Sandra made me for the road that is keeping me in kicking.  Now it’s time for some sleep and to wake up in a wholly new part of the world!</p>
      <p>-PS</p>
      <p>note: there is a bunch of media that should go along with this post, but I don’t have a good enough connection right now tfo be able to upload anything.  Text is going to have to do for the time being and I’ll upload the fun stuff as soon as possible.  I’ve got some clips of the guitarist on the castle roof, panoramas from both the castle and Cerro san Cristobal, timelapse coming down from san Cristobal, cathedral photos, some video from the rooftop pool, lots of food pictures and well, you get the idea...I’ve been recording all of this in some way or another.  :) </p>

      <p>In forty days or so I'm taking a flight from San Francisco, CA to Santiago,
      Chile.  If all goes to plan it will take me a little under twenty-three hours
      to get there, and from there the details are sparse.  </p> <p>I'll arrive in
      the very early morning of the twenty-third of February, catch a bus into the
      city with a pile of tightly packed bags and a big box containing a stripped
      down bike.  The idea is to find a place to stay in Santiago for a few days while
      my friend Lorenzo makes his way up from exploring the southern region of Chile
      known to most as Patagonia.  </p> <p>During those few days I'll piece together
      my bike, gather any final pieces of required gear, and explore what the sprawling
      city of Santiago has to offer a twenty-something millennial...in the safest
      ways possible. I may take a few rides to surrounding towns to <span class='strike'>stay get
      in shape before the real fun begins.</p> <p>Lorenzo and I meet up somewhere
      in Santiago around the first of March. We'll fill up our water bottles, pack
      as much food into any space our panniers allow and head westward to Valparaiso.
       The final destination - though we know there is no such thing - so let's call
      it the goal for this adventure is to make it back up to San Francisco, CA some
      time in late 2016.  Eight months and somewhere near 10,000 miles, cycling through
      completely unknown lands.  Shit.  </p> <p>I'm scared. I'm excited. I'm anxious.
      Above all I'm happy.  There will be pain. A lot of it. There will also be learning
      - hopefully more of that than the pain.  Most important, to me, will be the
      expansion of perspective.  I've grown up and lived in California my whole life.
       Although many here would like you to think it true, there is not a lot of diversity
      in California.  Not in the ways or for the reasons that matter at least.  It
      will be fascinating to see how those in what we now call developing nations
      live.  I need that.  We all need that, and although that's not my reason for
      going on this journey I'm sure it will be one of the most profound parts of
      it. </p> <p>So then, why am I doing this? Still haven't actually figured that
      out.  The best I can come up with is because I can. Also, I haven't been able
      to come up with a convincing reason as to <em>why not.  </em>One thing's for
      sure, I'm making some fucking lemonade.</p> <p>I'll try to post updates here
      as often as time, internet and energy allow.  I'm sure I'll need moral support
      more than anything so comments are always welcomed.  </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Patrick</p>"
